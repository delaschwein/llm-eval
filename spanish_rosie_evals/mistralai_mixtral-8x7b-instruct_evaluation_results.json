If a baby's poop is not soft or does not pass easily, then it may be constipated. In rare cases, constipation can be caused by a lack of nerves that go to the intestines or by a problem with how the intestine formed at birth. A baby may be tested for these conditions if their healthcare provider feels it is necessary.\n\nScore rubrics:\n\n* Preference: Do you prefer the reference or model_answer?\n\nScoring:\n\n* Score 1: Prefer reference\n* Score 5: Prefer model_answer",
